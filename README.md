# Microscopy-Image-Segmentation
Final Academic Project | Computer Vision | signal processing | Python | Pytorch

1.1 Background
The project addresses the problem of Segmenting Microscopy Cell images in order to improve and enhance biological research capabilities.

1.2  Purpose
Improve the ability of Machine learning models to segment and detect cells in microscopy images.

1.3  Objectives:
To train a Machine Learning Model to segment cells out of a biological microscopy image. 

1.4 Innovation:
Creating a U-net capable of classifying the image into 3 different classes using input preprocessing image processing methods.

1.5 Proposed Method:
Our method involves building a U-net [-] architecture model and augmenting the data given to us using many different types of augmentations [] to create a more diverse dataset. also optimizing the model and the hyperparameters in order to achieve the best results of the specific data set.

1.6 Expected Results:
The expectation is that our newly trained model will improve upon the old models currently existing and be able to segment and track cells more accurately.
